 For this assignment I was trying to play around with some euclidian rhythms and stacking chords.
 Obviously, the stacking chords part didn't happen because I, for some reason, cannot figure out how to stack
 note messages. I feel like I'm missing some very simple concept with the stacking and I haven't been able to find it in the documentation yet.
 For the project I wanted to stack the arpegiated chords in 3rds and have the euclidian rhythms so it creates this oscilating effect
 with the harmony. To compensate for my lack of stacked chords, I instead added some distortion and delay to make this loop a little more complicated.

 I stole some code from the documentation on how to format the distortion and delay arguments. I still don't fully understand how the argument works but what I
 noticed is that there's multiple numbers within the distortion and delay time that appears to change each cycle and thereby change the level of distortion
 and delay within the instrument.
