<h3>
CHUCK YOGURT
</h3>

<p>
 CHUCK YOGURT grew up in Booger Hole, West Virginia, and always dreamed of expanding his diameter to scopes beyond god’s plan. Unfortunately, CHUCK YOGURT’s mother died before he was born. He suffered intense damages that caused a need to expand his views on Arizonian society. When he was 7, 3 years after his mother gave him a guitar, BOGUS became best friends with CHUCK YOGURT, who taught him everything about width.

<h3>
  BOGUS
</h3>

<p>
When it comes to love, BOGUS also grew up in Booger Hole. Being well taught by his archery master, BOGUS fell in love with the Amplified Network Router. After years of study at the conservatory, BOGUS started experimenting with distortion pedals and reverb pedals, creating his signature sound. After passing out in a bar, CORNELIOUS sprayed narcan on BOGUS, and they became best friends. The band started to shape itself.

  <h3>
CORNELIOUS
  </h3>

  <p>
    CORNELIOUS was born in Coke County, Texas. CORNELIOUS never liked music, but loved noise. “If noise is uncomfortable sound, then pop music is noise to me.” CORNELIOUS studied across the entire Coke County to find the perfect polyphonic metallic microwave teacher, and it wasn’t until high school that CORNELIOUS finally found his master. Diving deeply into his craft, CORNELIOUS felt inclined to travel, and prove his polyphonic metallic microwave skills to the world.
