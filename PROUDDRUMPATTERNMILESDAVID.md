 For this project I kinda wanted to emulate the drum groove from this old UK funk tune from the 80s.

 This was a pretty straightforward assignment because I have a lot of experience with step sequencers and can visualize the rhythms I'm generating in real time.
 I did want to get a little freaky with the drum patterns and add some ghost notes on the bass that only trigger sometimes and also have some weird repeats.
 I tried repeating 100 times at first but that was a little too chaotic so I had to take it down to about 10. I wanted it to have a kind of drunken feel rather than just straight noise.
 I did play with tempo a little bit to try and find a good balance and 130bpm seemed to be pretty steady.
 I also set up a little repeat on the snare drum on the last cell to add some craziness in there.
 My debugging this time around wasn't so much "things not working", rather just getting the best groove. I did use some code from the Github just to set up the stack, but the drum groove is all my own design.
