## What I Did

I tried to make a simple patch with multiple lead sounds that harmonize in odd ways and have a polyrhythmic relationship without having to use any specific polyrhythm specific commands.... Because I don't know how to use them yet.

## What Went Right and Wrong

Well I got the thing to work which was good but I was really struggling to understand some of the syntax of Tidal cycles. I understood Studel very clearly and I think that is partly due to how great the documentation is. I was trying to port some strudel ideas I had over to Tidal but it wasn't exactly working. I utilized some code from the class repo to get me started with the arps and expanded from there. I also used some drum programing from the class repo that I messed around with,
I was successfully able to break Tidal with my last line. The server ran out of memory which I did find funny. Overall not a whole lot to say about this one. Just getting familiar with the toolset.
