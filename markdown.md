# Final Project

**IMNOTMILESDAVIS PORTFOLIO SITE**


## WHAT

A PORTFOLIO SITE TO SHOWCASE MY VARIOUS MUSIC PROJECTS AND SELL MY ART.

## WHY

I LITERALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE ANYTHING MORE COMPLICATED THAN THIS, AND I HAVE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH CSS AND HTML WHICH MADE IT MORE OF A REFRESHER PROCESS, RATHER THAN COMPLETELY LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE AND ATTEMPTING TO DEBUG A LANGUAGE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IN SHORT, IT WAS ACHIEVABLE FOR MY AND VERY USEFUL.

## MOTIVATION

My motivation for my final project was to create a portfolio (and web art) site that I can direct my fans/potential clients to in order to -

- Showcase my various music projects and have samples for people to listen to
- Buy my music and merchandise
- Play around with old internet webart
- Have a little bit of webart fun

## PHILOSOPHY

- Make a website that is funny but not an assault on the senses
- Make the website easily navigable
- Incorporate as much old internet history as possible
- Simplicity over complexity
- Make it look like I intentionally didn't use my web design skills rather than possessing no skills in the first place

## INSPIRATIONS

- I was very inspired by the bejalvin.com website. I'm friends with
Jake of Bejalvin and always loved their bizarre web design and did steal the background because it was the Windows XP backgorund. Beautiful.
- I was inspired by the Space Jam website from the 1990s. I didn't end up taking anything specific from the website but I did like the vibes and wanted to mimic them.
- Eric Andre's website. I love the fever dream aspect of Eric's website and wanted to steal the vibes of confusing mess for my website.

## SYSTEM

- Currently I am using my imnotmilesdavis.github.io to host my website. I was going to use Dreamhost but I was going to end up spending too much money, and I was having difficulty getting the back end to work for the server and I didn't want to fiddle with it. I'd rather spend my time on the actual website rather than getting it to work on one specific hosting platform.
- I created multiple html and css files corresponding to the page content they contain - capitalism, hacienda, etc. and had them linked to each other through a top nav bar.
- I did not use any Java Script for this website as I didn't really need the website to be very interactive, plus I'm not great at Java. Everything is pretty static on the website.

## ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS

- I had a lot of issues trying to implement Payhip into the site. I attempted to use their embed tools but they only allow you to embed a "Buy" button that has no title, images, etc. I attempted to create a plot of items and have each be individually coded and embed images and links to a specific product page, but it became too difficult. I ended up using BandCamp embeds to my music, which was much easier.

- Small problem - I found out that when we connect CSS files to our HTML, the names of the files are caps sensitive. Good to know.

- Fonts sometimes show up as something different on mobile. I use the Comic Sans font throughout the website and, for some reason, my iPhone shows it as some cursive text I've never seen before. I tried a few different web browsers on my computer and had consistent success with the website, but it appears iPhones think Comic Sans MS in a CSS file mean cursive.
