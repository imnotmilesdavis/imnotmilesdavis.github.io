## Problems faced

Truth be told, we didn't have many problems with the site. Everything was fairly straight forward. The main (but small) issue we faced was using an FAVICON that would appear as a web icon next to the title of the website. We weren't able to get it to work. It could've been a GitHub specific problem related to hosting through them, or we could've been using HTML 4 standard code instead of HTML 5. We're not quite sure and we didn't have enough time to trouble shoot.

## Self Assessment

I contributed to the group heavily - I hosted the website on my GitHub, typed in all the code for the website both HTML and CSS, gathered assets, and troubleshooted various aspects of the website. I was working pretty frantically to get it all done but we made it happen.

## Group Member contributions

Timmy was responsible for creating the bios of the group and creating the plot line.

Samuel was responsible for being a second set of eyes looking at the template code and communicating what functions needed to be called in the website. He also contributed a photo and created the name of the band.
